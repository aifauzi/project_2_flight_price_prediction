## Case Background
At this project, I start to used modeling algorithm to solve a task. The algorithm I used are <u>Supervised Learning</u> method with problem about prediction price tikcet of flight. I also to used <u>Hyperparameter Tunning</u> to search the best hyperparameter I can choose. Last but not least, I create some deployment application with <u>Streamlit</u> and store to <u>HuggingFace</u>.

If you like to tell me something about my project, feel free!
